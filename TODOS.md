### Important To-dos

- Document how to use Flick itself
- Move compiler/, lexer/, and parser/ into a lib
- Maybe define flick build and flick run subcommands (mimicking cargo)

### Maybe one day...
- Allow ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª as a synonym for something (e.g. return)
- Write a syntax highlighting extension for code editors

### Done
