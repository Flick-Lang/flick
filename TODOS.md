### Quick Todos

- [ ] Make `Typer` take the program in its `new()`
- [ ] Make all module and crate level docstrings start with `//!` instead of `///` and
- [ ] Move `types.rs` into `typing` module and fix the ignored example in `typing/mod.rs` docstring

### Important Todos

- [ ] Give an overview of how the compiler works in README
- [ ] Document how to use Flick itself
- [x] Move compiler/, lexer/, and parser/ into a lib
- [ ] Maybe define flick build and flick run subcommands (mimicking cargo)
- [x] Be consistent with what's pub, pub(crate), etc.
- [x] Rename lexer/ to lexing/; rename parser/ to parsing/; rename compiler/ to compilation/. This way, we avoid
  lexer/lexer.rs, and so we can delete `#[allow(clippy::module_inception)]`
- [ ] I think parse_return_statement() processes a semicolon but do we allow semicolons everywhere? Just try making a
  test that has semicolons mixed in with newlines
- [ ] Add cargo doc to the list of things that GitHub checks before commit
- [ ] Don't allow pull requests to merge without passing tests, getting approval, and being warning free
- [ ] Deploy the docs and attach link to README.md
- [ ] Make a playground for the programming language (with python backend first?)
    - https://ace.c9.io is what rust uses
- [ ] make a playground with wasm
- [ ] pointers
- [ ] Rethink what structs/files/struct properties/functions in flick should be public vs pub(crate) vs private
- [ ] ScopeManager and Type are both structs that belong across all modules of the compiler. Maybe they should be moved
  out of their respective module into the root 'src' folder (or somewhere else)?
- [ ] Take all lexer tokens, parsing trees, etc. as references instead of owning
- [ ] Remove all clones / think about slices / lifetimes
- [ ] Only have one of ComparisonOperator and ComparisonSymbol (and same for BinaryOperator and BinarySymbol)
- [ ] Maybe remove all * imports in all source files
- [ ] Either use () in structs or use { } in struct properties

### Maybe one day...

- [ ] Allow ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª as a synonym for something (e.g. return)
- [ ] Write a syntax highlightâ‰¥ing extension for code editors
- [ ] Support importing files (by compiling multiple programs in LLVM)
